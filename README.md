# Sachin Agrawal

### Student and Developer

I am a self-taught programmer who knows Swift, Objective/Arduino C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, PHP, Ruby, and Bash/Shell. <br>
I'm into iOS/WatchOS app and game development, so I joined the Apple Developer Program but many of my apps are open source, not published. <br>
I have also created several apps, games, and clockfaces for Fitbit Versa smartwatches, some of which are open source on GitHub as well. <br>
I am a full-stack web developer who has coded multiple websites (see below) and has also made a custom device details plugin for YOURLS. <br>
Other projects I have worked on include making two fun Discord bots and many math/science programs for TI-84 Plus CE calculators. <br>
Iâ€™ve gotten into 3D printing/modeling with my Prusa, and while I am no expert at CAD, I have posted a few of my designs on Printables. <br>
In my free time, I like to play the popular block-based videogame Minecraft, and I post primarily Minecraft videos on my YouTube channel. <br>
Some of my other hobbies besides coding and Minecraft include playing the violin, traveling, photography, lacrosse, rickrolling, and reading. <br>

## Websites
All websites are hosted using GitHub pages since I never renewed the domains associated with them.
