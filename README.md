# Sachin Agrawal

## High School Student; Washington, DC

I am a self-taught programmer who knows Swift, Objective/Arduino C, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, LaTeX, PHP, Ruby, and Bash/Shell. 
I have created several apps, games, and clockfaces for Fitbit Versa smartwatches, some of which are open source on my Github.
I'm a full-stack web developer who owns multiple websites, including link shorteners made using YOURLS and some custom plugins.
I'm now more into iOS/WatchOS app and game development so I joined the Apple Developer Program and spend most of my time on that.
Other projects I have worked on include two fun Discord bots and calculus programs for my TI-84 Plus CE calculator.
In my free time, I like to play the popular block-based videogame Minecraft, and post Minecraft videos on YouTube.
Some of my other hobbies besides coding and Minecraft include playing the violin, lacrosse, rickrolling, and reading.
